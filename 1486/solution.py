        if n % 4 == 0, there will be an even number of 2, and the xor of them is 0.

        if n % 4 == 1, you can exclude the last numebr which is start + 2 * (n - 1).
        The xor of left numbers is 0, so the result is last.

        if n % 4 == 2, you can exclude the last two numbers. The xor of left numbers is 0,
        so the result is the xor of last two numbers which is 2.
        
        if n % 4 == 3, you can exclude the last three numbers. The xor of left numbers is 0,
        so the result is the xor of last three numbers which is 2 ^ last.

        if start % 4 == 2 or 3, the second bit from right is 1, but the (start + 2) % 4 == 0 or 1.
        So we can exclude the first number.
        So the solution to calculate the left numbers is the same as the solution above.
